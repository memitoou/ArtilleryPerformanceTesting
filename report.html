        <h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
        <p>This report reflects the system's performance under different load levels. Below is an interpretation of the results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Completed Requests:</strong> A total of 930 requests were made during the test. Of these, 930 were successful, representing 100.00% of the total.</li>
            <li><strong>Errors:</strong> There were 930 errors during the test, representing 100.00% of all requests. This may indicate that the server was unable to handle the full load.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Response Time:</strong> The average server response time was 269.70 ms. A lower time is ideal, but it is also important to observe the maximum times.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Response Time:</strong> The maximum recorded time was 2045 ms, indicating that at some moments the system took quite a while to respond.</li>
            <li><strong>95th Percentile:</strong> 95% of the requests had a response time of less than 608.00 ms, suggesting that performance was acceptable in most cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, the results indicate that the system was able to handle a large number of requests, but some users may have experienced elevated response times or errors due to overload.</p>
